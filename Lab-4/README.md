# Independent work:
 
2.	Open and read the file 'text1.txt' containing k books.
3.	Preprocess the data from the given file. 
4.	Cluster the data using k-means algorithm. Specify k = 2, 3 and 4 clusters. 
5.	Show the clustering results in subplots.
6.	Use silhouette for finding the optimal number of clusters. Show in subplots the silhouette values for k=2, k=3 and k=4. 
7.	Make conclusion about the optimal number of clusters. 
Write your conclusion with explanations in the Word file result.docx.
8.	Divide the given text in k different books in according to the received results up to resolution of 5000 symbols. Add to result.docx your conclusion about the place where each book starts (show symbol number interval of size 5000, e.g. “book 2 begin in the interval from 20000 to 25000”). Explain your answer.
9.	Write a function for automatic detection of the boundaries between books in the original file.
